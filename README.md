## react-server-rendering-example
---

An example of how to do React server-side rendering with frontend library dependencies. The app renders a simple React component containing a Bootstrap form that uses ValidateJS for form validation and Jquery for form submission. Frontend libraries are managed through a separate `browser_dependencies` module. See this [blog post](http://ryandao.net/reactjs-server-side-rendering-with-browser-dependencies/) for the detailed explanation.

### How to run

    npm install
    node server.js

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
